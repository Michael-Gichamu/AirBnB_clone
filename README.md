## Description

AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and a front-end interface.

This is the 1st part of our AirBnb clone project. Creating a command-line interface(CLI) that serves as a management system for Airbnb Clone web application.

The console allows users to interact with the application by executing commands to perform various operations, such as creating and managing objects, retrieving data, updating and deleting information.

The console acts as an interface between the user and the underlying functionality of the Airbnb Clone application. It provides a convenient way to interact with the application without requiring direct access to the code or database. By entering commands in the console, users can perform actions and manage data within the application.
